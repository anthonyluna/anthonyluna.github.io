      Where are we headed to celebrate:
      Camp Arnaz is located in the lower Ojai Valley and inland from the city of Ventura. Camp Arnaz is named after
      Actor
      Desi Arnaz who previously owned the property, which was purchased by the Girl Scouts of CA Central Coast in 1975.
      Camp Arnaz has recently been designated as a Monarch Breeding and Research Institute with pollinator gardens. It
      is
      also home to a variety of wildlife, including red-eared turtles, herons, fish, squirrels, owls, blue jays,
      swallows,
      woodpeckers, red tailed hawks and more!

      Location and Directions:

      Camp Arnaz
      155 Sulphur Mountain Rd, Ventura, CA 93001

      Note: once you are on Highway 33, it is a sudden and slight right-hand turn so keep your eyes peeled.

      We are super excited for this opportunity to see (and in some cases meet anew!) folks! And if you want to start
      the
      fun a bit early, in a more casual scene, we would definitely benefit from some help putting things together!
      Absolutely no pressure, but if you love to be part of the makings of things we would love your company in the
      making
      of the following parts of the wedding:

      Empanada Baking
      March 9th, 2pm, Oxnard, CA
      We’ll be learning Nancy Luna’s amazing recipe for empanadas, chatting and folding up empanadas.

      Bouquet Making
      March 10th, 10am, Camp Arnaz
      We’ll be making many bouquets at Camp Arnaz.

      Decorations
      March 10th 2pm, Camp Arnaz
      Hanging lights and setting up the space.
