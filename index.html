      <p><strong>Simone's Perspective:</strong></p>
      <p class="left-aligned">
        Anthony and I met on the day before graduate studies began. It was a fall evening in the school courtyard and our
        entire cohort was there to meet our fellow classmates. The moment I saw Anthony I was so curious to meet him! I played
        it cool and we finally bumped into each other as the sun was setting. We hit it off right away. We talked for a while
        about travels and family…
      </p>
      <p class="left-aligned">
        After that, I'd see him in classes or around campus, and each time my heart would speed up a bit. But it wasn't too
        startling because we were both so busy that we hardly saw each other. Occasionally, we would see each other in the
        break room and Anthony would always have some snack to share. He'd hand me a persimmon or handful of
        trail mix and we'd stand together munching and chatting until one of us had to go somewhere. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="left-aligned">
        It went like that for at least a couple months until we finally made a “date” to study together. The fact that 
        winter break had just begun and there were no looming deadlines, didn't deter us from dedicating our evening to the library. 
        Also, recently a wildfire had broken out and was blazing toward Santa Barbara. Even knowing that, we still sat 
        and studied together for 4 hours. It felt like a study standoff. Finally, we called it quits and said goodbye. 
        I regretted it was over, although I was not so sad that I no longer needed to focus my attention on Earth Sciences. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="left-aligned">
        After walking home that same evening, I got a text from Anthony inviting me to dinner and we went out on our first
        date – which was amazingly relaxed, especially considering that Anthony was encouraged to evacuate due to the fire.
        We said our goodnights and planned to meet after winter break, and Anthony kindly wrote down his folks' address, in
        case I too was evacuated later that evening. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="left-aligned">
        And it went like that. Lots of things could have torn us apart, but instead they brought us together. The rest is a
        unique tapestry of finishing school, navigating a pandemic, getting to know each other as friends, colleagues,
        housemates, and life partners. I would say it was “love at first sight” because he is so handsome, but I think 
        I fall in love with Anthony over and over again, because it seems like we are always changing
        and meeting each other anew.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Anthony's Perspective:</strong></p>
      <p class="left-aligned">
        Simone and I first met at the tail end of a mixer at the tail end of our Master's program orientation. 
        I asked if she was a PhD student, because I hadn't seen her around all week, to which she laughed and said 
        she was a first-year, like me. She then revealed that she had just returned from a trip to France to visit 
        her good friend Grace Williams. I thought that was a great reason to miss orientation. I then felt 
        obligated to speak <em>at</em> Simone in French as one might do after a few drinks, especially when trying to impress 
        a beautiful woman. 
      </p>
      <p class="left-aligned">
        The next time I saw Simone, we were in the common room kitchen with a few classmates, 
        trying to finish a coding assignment. Everyone had questions, and since I already had experience with the computer programming 
        language, The R Language, I was able to share some answers. This is when Simone and I 
        first exchanged contact information, and I was added to her phone as "The R Extraordinaire," in case she had more questions. 
        I was elated at the prospect of studying with her again - she made everything more fun, even coursework.
      </p>
      <p class="left-aligned">
        Another week passed, and we both found ourselves at a networking event with ~20 of our classmates in 
        downtown Santa Barbara. Afterwards, we were going to go to a house party nearby. Simone and I started walking 
        and talking and found ourselves separated from the group. I thought she knew where we were going, but after our second 
        strange turn I realized we were completely lost - neither of us minded. We bantered while walking through the neighborhoods near 
        State Street. Simone picked flowers and placed them carefully in my hair. No one had ever put flowers in my hair before that. It surprised me and I loved it.
      </p>
      <p class="left-aligned">
        After that night, I knew we needed to go on a date - a proper date, not one under the guise of a networking event 
        or a homework assignment. I brought her snacks every day so we had a reason to chat, but never got too deep into conversation since we were busy with classes. Then one day, we 
        worked on an assignment for at least 7 hours. To be honest, I had been done with the assignment, but I 
        continued to format the document needlessly as we chatted and clacked away on our keyboards. Finally, she said she was done, 
        and I said me too, then as we walked down the hall she had to stop to use the restroom and I thought she was trying to give me a 
        hint to buzz off so I bid her goodnight. A bit disappointed, I walked to the bus 
        stop, got on my bus, sat down, and realized I was an absolute idiot. I texted my sister Shamsi, and she confirmed that 
        yes, I was an idiot. I texted Simone <em>very</em> casually if she wanted to get dinner (thanks to Shamsi's guidance) 
        and thankfully she said yes. It was a great night, one I'll never forget. 
      </p>
      <p class="left-aligned">
        I began to fall in love with Simone the first time I met her, and have been falling more and more for her every day since.

        Institute with pollinator gardens. It is also home to a variety of wildlife, including red-eared turtles,
