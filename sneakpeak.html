      <h1 class="section_header">How we met</h1>
      <p><strong>Simone's Perspective:</strong></p>
      <p class="left-aligned">
        Anthony and I met on the day before graduate studies began. It was a fall evening in the school courtyard and our
        entire cohort was there to meet our fellow classmates. The moment I saw Anthony I was so curious to meet him! I played
        it cool and we finally bumped into each other as the sun was setting. We hit it off right away. We talked for a while
        about travels and family…
      </p>
      <p class="left-aligned">
        After that, I'd see him in classes or around campus, and each time my heart would speed up a bit. But it wasn't too
        startling because we were both so busy that we hardly saw each other. Occasionally, we would see each other in the
        break room and Anthony would always have fruit fresh off a tree to share. He'd silently open up a handful of
        persimmons and trail mix when I saw him and I'd stand and munch with him until one of us had to go somewhere. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="left-aligned">
        It went like that for at least a few months until we finally made a “date” to study together in the library. It
        didn't matter that winter break had just begun and no assignment was really that urgent or that a fire was blazing its
        way into Santa Barbara. We sat and studied together for 4 hours. It felt like a study standoff. Finally, we called it
        quits and said goodbye. I regretted it was over, although I was not so sad that I no longer needed to focus my
        attention on economics. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="left-aligned">
        After walking home that same evening, I got a text from Anthony inviting me to dinner and we went out on our first
        date – which was amazingly relaxed, especially considering that Anthony's home had become part of the evacuation zone.
        We said our goodnights and planned to meet after winter break, and Anthony kindly wrote down his folks' address, in
        case I too was evacuated later that evening. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="left-aligned">
        And it went like that. Lots of things could have torn us apart, but instead they brought us together. The rest is a
        unique tapestry of finishing school, navigating a pandemic, getting to know each other as friends, colleagues,
        housemates, and now looking forward into a long future together.I would say it was “love at first sight” because he is
        so handsome, but I think I fall in love with Anthony over and over again, because it seems like we are always changing
        and meeting each other anew.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Anthony's Perspective:</strong></p>
      <p class="left-aligned">
        Simone and I first met at the tail end of a mixer at the tail end of our Master's program orientation. 
        I asked if she was a PhD student, because I hadn't seen her around all week to which she laughed and said 
        she was a first year like me. She then revealed that she had just returned from a trip in France to visit 
        her good friend Grace Williams, which I thought that was a great reason to miss orientation. I then felt 
        obligated to speak <em>at</em> Simone in French as you do after a few drinks, especially when trying to swoon 
        and impress a beautiful woman. I didn't want to stop our lively conversation, and so asked if she wanted 
        to continue the mixer with other fellow grad students at a local bar - she declined and left me yearning 
        for another encounter.
      </p>
      <p class="left-aligned">
        During our first few weeks of classes, I saw Simone and a few classmates in the common room kitchen 
        clamouring to finish a coding assignment. I already had experience with the computer programming 
        language we were using, The R Language, so I joined the group to lend a hand. This is when Simone and I 
        first exchanged contact info, and I was known to her as "The R Extraordinaire". I was elated at the prospect 
        of studying with her again - she made everything more fun, even coursework.
      </p>
      <p class="left-aligned">
        Another week past, and we both found ourselves at a networking event with around 20 of our classmates in 
        downtown Santa Barbara. Afterwards, a group were going to go to a house party down the street, and Simone 
        and I found each other. We started walking and talking and found ourselves separated from the group. I thought 
        she knew where we were going, but after our second strange turn I realized we were completely lost - but neither 
        of us minded. We talked about family played word games with each other while walking through the neighborhoods 
        near State street. Simone picked flowers as we walked, and placed them carefully in my hair. No one had ever 
        done that to me before and I loved it.
      </p>
      <p class="left-aligned">
        After this night, I knew we needed to go on a date - a proper date, not one under the guise of a networking event 
        or a homework assignment, but I didn't know when the right time was to ask. I brought her snacks every day
        so I had a reason to chat, but never got too into the one on one since we were busy with classes. Then one day we 
        worked on an assignment for at least 7 hours. To be honest, I had been done with the assignment for a while, but I 
        continued to format the document needlessly as we chatted and clacked away on our keyboards. Finally, she said she was done, 
        and I said me too, then as we walked down the hall she said "I have to use the restroom" and I said awkwardly "Oh, okay, have a 
        good night..." thinking maybe she was trying to give me a hint to buzz off. A bit disappointed, I walked to the bus 
        stop, got on my bus, sat down and realized I was an absolute fool. I texted my sister Shamsi, and she confirmed that 
        yes, I was an idiot. I texted Simone <em>very</em> casually if she wanted to get dinner (thanks to Shamsi's guidance) 
        and thankfully she said yes. It was a great night, one I'll never forget. I began to fall in love with Simone the 
        first time I met her, and have been falling more and more for her every day since.
